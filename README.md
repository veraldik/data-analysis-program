# data-analysis-program
A simple program used to run a small data analysis for a college research project. (Python)

Each py file scans a csv and returns data. Created for a college class where no one in my group knew how to run a 
proper data analysis. 

Our group completed a research project and paper about music trends and streaming services. The goal of the 
program was to find connections between listening habits and the amount of time spent listening to music on streaming 
services. Also used the program to test for differences in listening habits between genders, age groups and 
ethnicities. 

The research paper, with our methods, findings and results, is included in the repo if you're interested!
